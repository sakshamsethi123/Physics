Physics problems

Hello, I am a middle schooler. I love to think, especially in the areas of math and physics. I keep thinking about things in Physics that I have been studying in the Giancoli Physics book. The problems mentioned in this Github Repo are either made by me or are a problem in the Giancoli book.


Also, if you find any errors in my proofs, please report back to me. It will improve my skills.
